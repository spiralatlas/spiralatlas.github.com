<p>So the day started with me banging my newly hired mobility scooter INTO THE WALL of our apartment building and leaving a HUGE HOLE. Which was not great. But the security guard was nice about it after we showed ourselves happy to leave our details, and organised an easier way in and out via the garage. I spent the rest of the day VERY AWARE of this thing's massive turning circle. My husband Cam was an absolute life-saver, cheering me up and getting me stuff.</p>
<p>Also I managed to GET A SMOOTHIE IN THE END. I noodled south to the South Mebourne Markets, a hub of fancy food places which are only open a few days a week, and had a very nice if expensive vegan salted caramel smoothie and also a nice apple and raspberry sorbet from Fritz Gelato.</p>
<p>Anyway, on to the actual conference :)</p>
<p><strong>The student games:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><a href="http://unbondgame.com/wp/">Unbond</a></span>: a cute platform puzzler I actually managed to enjoy??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/harvest-hands">Harvest Hands</a></span> a 3D farming sim, like Stardew Valley in the style of Slime Rancher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/JustBearly_game">Just Bearly</a></span> an interesting series of metaphorical vignettes about awkwardness and anxiety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><a href="http://cartathegame.com/">Carta</a></span> A very clever puzzle platformer where you rearrange the platforms, won the Student Showcase award.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/TeamFourthEye">Lacuna</a></span> A point and click murder mystery using time travel and a really interesting connect the clues mechanic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Komorebi (I couldn't find a link): a cute turn-based rpg using cards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Misc Convention Stuff:</strong>
I didn't mention this before but they had gender neutral toilets! I felt too self conscious to use the 'men's but it was nice to have the option.
Also the volunteers were super concerned and helpful when my wheelchair broke. They didn't end up being able to fix it but tried really hard.</p>
<p>One of the speakers actually remembered non binary people exist one time when talking about gender bias in the industry!</p>
<p>I didn't go to the awards ceremony because it was at night and also I find awards super boring but seeing everyone talk about it on social media later it sounds like it would have been cool to go.</p>
<p><strong>Opening Keynote: Tony Albrecht from RIOT games</strong></p>
<p>He showed the path his career has taken, and where he and his early colleagues have ended up, updating a world map labeled with a network of connections.</p>
<p>He started out in Adelaide in 1999, he realised he was utterly miserable at his (mining?) job and wanted to get into games. His friends and family thought this was a terrible idea.</p>
<p>He went to AGDC and met other people like himself, forming Ratbag games in Adelaide.</p>
<p>Then they got bought out by a huge company and put in charge of a huge IP, based on a movie, with lots of potential...
and the project and his company got scrapped.</p>
<p>And then he joined  anew little company and exactly the same thing happened again. And then <em>again</em>.</p>
<p>During one of these shakeups he managed to jump sideways to the US branch of the company via some guys he met at a party.</p>
<p>Is this kind of thing nepotism? Photo of Donald Trump and family. No, because it's not just about who you know and trust, it's also about competence. And when you meet someone in person it makes it easier to judge cultural fit. (He did not talk about how this kind of &quot;cultural fit&quot; tends to benefit white dudes such as himself. Also, I’ll pedantically point out it it would be 'cronyism' since it's not about family. Anyway, he’s right that for good or ill this _is _how things work)</p>
<p>The GFC caused a lot of people to lose their jobs, which was a horrible experience, but also brought down the dinosaurs of the industry, leaving space for the little mammal indies to feast on the dinosaur's bones.</p>
<p>In his final diagram, 22 people (I didn't follow who. People from Ratbag?) ended up covering 57 studios. All of those studios are now in a position to judge if he is any good, both competent and good to work with.</p>
<p>You can't just be good, you have to be <em>known</em> to be good, and good to work with. Market yourself.</p>
<p>Be both humble and ambitious.</p>
<p>Go to parties and meet people, but don't get so drunk you make an asshole of yourself.</p>
<p>Speak at conferences. He showed a photo of GDC and one of a games conference in Tehran, I found it interesting that the
latter had way more people who I read as women (and of course was less
universally white)</p>
<p>Surround yourself with people you want to be like, and be like the people you want to surround yourself with.</p>
<p>He's now at RIOT, a huge American company, and there are four people from Ratbag there.</p>
<p><strong>Why ladders are Awesome: A game design lesson in spatial design</strong>
Jennifer Schuerle Opaque Space @Gaohmee
Training Astronauts with VR.</p>
<p>Visual stimuli guidance, tell players what to do and where to go. Lights: Points of interest. Colour theory. Positive vs negative feelings, mood. Logical pathways. Repetitive visuals guide players towards a goal.</p>
<p>Firewatch given as an example as being good at guiding the player (which shows that this stuff can be subjective because I got lost so much I had to give up haha) Uncharted, too.</p>
<p>More than just &quot;good architecture&quot;. Oni used real architects as level designers and it was bad. The layout was boring and samey.</p>
<p>UX behavioural science.</p>
<p>Player expectations: a rusted barrel with a “flammable” symbol on it is read as &quot;Shoot me and I will explode&quot;, which would weird people out in a pacifist game.</p>
<p>Health pack: Illegal to use a red cross against a white background for health. Instead people use a red H, blue cross etc.</p>
<p>Lock down parameters. How long should it take? Mission metrics. Visual themes. What need is this space supposed to fulfill?</p>
<p>Context: what does the player already know? eg in LA Noire you learn early that golden handles means an openable door.</p>
<p>Pacing: tension and mood is created by going from a confined space to large space, from dark to light. Make the player look away before a jump scare.</p>
<p>Explicit: Instructions telling the player exactly what to do.
Implicit: in the environment
Emergent: What the player makes up in conjunction with what is given by the game.</p>
<p>Some bad corridors:</p>
<p>Minecraft portal: doesn't look like it leads anywhere, looks like a dead end.</p>
<p>Portal corridor has extrusions in the wall hiding an upcoming intersection.</p>
<p>A good corridor: light highlights door, small flight of stairs hints to progression, hint of a curving corridor beyond the door, shows edge of the next room. Raised viewpoint makes it easier to see.</p>
<p>Ladders, interactive objects: must be clearly designed, grab attention, can lead to a surprise because you know where the player is facing and have a reason for things to change.</p>
<p>Buttons control exactly where the player is facing. It controls expectation.</p>
<p>Super Mario is a masterclass of level design. Include objects which illustrate the rules of the world.</p>
<p>Cognitive priming: Foreshadowing. If you show them before they have to do it they will do better.</p>
<p>(Alice?) shows you what you're going to do next with flythroughs, view from a hill etc. Gets players to follow the intended path.</p>
<p>Gone Home is one of the most important walking sims. You explore the world and character.</p>
<p>Players more on board if invested. Give them time to connect to characters and environments.</p>
<p>Give time, show they can trust your design.</p>
<p>Earthlight Arcade: 15 minute virtual space walk on the outside of international space station.</p>
<p>New technology means new challenges, for both devs and players.</p>
<p>Collaboration with NASA requires a commitment to a certain level of realism.</p>
<p>Astronaut suits are fucking annoying. Obstructs view, takes up lots of space.</p>
<p>Airlock: people have expectations that don't match actual airlocks. No up! Corridors tend to be round. Exit is on the side of the airlock, how do you point people towards it?</p>
<p>Cannot move without applying force, pulling on handlebars etc. People lean and it doesn't work. Can rotate in any direction when holding handlebars. (I asked if people get motion sickness and she said no, because they are in control, even if things work in unexpected ways)</p>
<p>The goal is to get the player to: learn how to move. Find the airlock hatch. Climb out feet first.</p>
<p>First attempt: &quot;Ladder&quot; of handlebars leading to airlock. Logos with text on to suggest an up. Didn't work.</p>
<p>Second Attempt: Narrow airlock so you have nowhere else to go but the door out. GIANT EXIT SIGN. Worked, but for the wrong reasons: players didn't notice the sign, there was just nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>People. Never. Read.
People. Never. Listen.</p>
<p>Whenever people are overwhelmed, new information is hard to retain. It doesn't matter how clear your solution seems to be if the player doesn't get it. It's your responsibility to make it work.</p>
<p>Earthlight Arcade is at PAX in the freeplay area!</p>
<p>Summary: Make mechanics come first, use spatial design as a support tool.</p>
<p>Design for the human perception. How do humans navigate environments?</p>
<p>Believable carefully crafted environments mean people will follow your lead.</p>
<p>j.Schuerle@gmail.com</p>
<p>Question: How do you keep track of the player's centre of gravity? You can't with the current model. Don't model below the stomach.</p>
<p>Question: How did NASA feel about this highly innaccurate airlock? There are multiple builds. An easier and less precise one for the public, a more exact one for NASA they add their own models. They have to worry about tethers etc.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Keynote: Striking the hammer: the Advocate’s journey</strong>
Kate Edwards
CEO &amp; Principal Consultant, Geogrify
Director of Outreach &amp; Board Member, Take This
Former Executive Director, IGDA
kate@geogrify.com Twitter: @geogrify</p>
<p>Scholarship to GDC.</p>
<p>Pushed against various things (crunch, sexism etc) During Gamergate was a primary target, as was the organisation. Once you have 100 arrows in your back you don't feel any more.</p>
<p>Now works with Take This which focuses on mental health.</p>
<p>Her influences: Watched the moon landing. Tolkein's map helped her on path to becoming a cartographer. Star Wars. Pong.</p>
<p>Writer (wanted to be astronaut, star wars conceptual artist) -&gt; cartographer -&gt; VR researcher -&gt; Geopolitical Strategist at MSFT -&gt; Cultural consultant on games -&gt; IGDA Executive Director -&gt; Raging Advocate</p>
<p>Who am I?
Created a unique Geopolitical career at Microsoft and Google.
Worked on every Microsoft game 1994-2005
Worked on [redacted] for [redacted]
Magazine columnist
(other stuff I missed)</p>
<p>But then she was overwhelmed with self doubt and imposter syndrome. Watching the Matrix: &quot;Don't think you are, know you are&quot;, she burst into tears.</p>
<p>She realised: Disbelief in your own skills doesn't make them disappear, or be invisible to those around you.</p>
<p>Know the reality of what others perceive in you, even if you struggle to think you have skills or not.</p>
<p>Imposter syndrome: What I know is a tiny subset of what everyone else knows.
Reality: they are two overlapping sets of about the same size. <span><a href="https://twitter.com/laurclinn/status/923065530348535808">The associated image</a></span></p>
<p>Comparison is the death of joy- Mark Twain.</p>
<p>Embrace your adversity. Treat it as your crucible, your forge. The Supreme Ordeal of the Heroes Journey.</p>
<p>Embrace your superpowers.</p>
<p>Even if it's self delusion it works. A bruise is a lesson and every lesson makes us better.</p>
<p>Be like Wonder Woman, stepping up out of the trench to stand up and do what's necessary. Only by emerging through the crucible can you do it.</p>
<p>Who am I? Someone who decided to give a shit. Evil triumphs when good people do nothing.</p>
<p>Cultural Change Catalyst</p>
<p>Change culture within:
Games: Helped people stop making games that would be problematic in other cultures.
Companies
The Games Industry</p>
<p>Why do I care? Love. Respect. Admiration. Passion.</p>
<p>Humans have told narratives since the dawn of time and we in the games industry are changing how that works in new ways.</p>
<p>It's not about rage.</p>
<p>It's about righteous rage: A reactive emotion of anger in response to mistreatment, insult ...injustice.</p>
<p>Injustice: Crunch. Lack of diversity. Screwing over indie devs is wrong.</p>
<p>Inaction. Complacency.</p>
<p>righteous rage=advocacy</p>
<p>She became fierce.</p>
<p>Does a lot of cosplay, daughter is a costume designer. Wear it for a day first. First day she wore the Thor costume she felt kickass. I'm not pretending to be Thor I <em>am</em> Thor. An external representation of how she feels about herself.</p>
<p>The fierce formula (drawn for Inktober) authenticity/adversity, maintain conviction over rejection, willpower + (Fear times zero).</p>
<p>&quot;Industry&quot; thought of as a machine where people are cogs. The &quot;industry&quot; is us. If you don't like it, change it.</p>
<p>Video games seen as a waste, causes violence, played by children and boys, cause obesity, motivated by money. Who controls this narrative? Noone in particular. But we need to work together to try to fix it.</p>
<p>Perceptions of sexism going up, concern about diversity also up.</p>
<p>Most people think crunch unnecessary. Read <span><a href="http://www.takethis.org/crunch-hurts-a-white-paper-commissioned-by-take-this/">Crunch hurts</a></span> on takethis.org about the mental health effects.</p>
<p>People say can't change can't happen quickly. Photo of Harvey Weinstein, Bill O'Reilly, Google manifesto dude. People say it takes time, but what it takes is willpower and people banding together. Change is punctuated.</p>
<p>FX network CEO decided to fix things.
2014 12% directors women or POC.
2016 51% directors women or POC.</p>
<p>Why can't games CEOs take a stand against crunch?</p>
<p>Focus on The Cause over the fear.</p>
<p>She would speak up against Gamergate again, despite knowing how she would be harassed later.</p>
<p>If everyone felt this way there'd be a wall of resistance, not just ripples but a tsunami.</p>
<p>Be willing to be relentless.
Fervently support each other.
Mentor each other. Reach out to people who need help.
Act with common will.</p>
<p>Common question: will there be a union? Interest continuously increases. She was vague about whether she thought it was a good idea.</p>
<p>There were suggestions to join with hollywood unions but game creators would never be respected by them.</p>
<p>Everyone in history who made a change was &quot;just one person&quot;. If you can't feed a hundred people just feed one.</p>
<p>She isn't trying to change the world, just her corner, that's the part she has chosen.</p>
<p>gameadvocacy.org (not up yet)
Reporting on specific issues
whistleblowing
public collective action on specific targets</p>
<p>Wonder woman from comics: when asked how strong she was, she said &quot;I don't know. It's difficult to find an upper limit against which to test myself&quot;</p>
<p>fiat justitia ruat caelum: Let justice be done though the heavens fall</p>
<p>She's turning 53, doesn't want to have to wait decades for games to be accepted as a medium.</p>
<p>She got a standing ovation.</p>
<p><strong>Closing speech:</strong>
Reminder that there is a strict code of conduct. If you see something and feel comfortable standing up we will be your shields. If you are not comfortable enough come and find the team.</p>
<p>Lots of thank yous. LOTS.</p>
