<p>And now, the notes I was working from.</p>
<p>This isn't about criticising violent games, they're a valid part of the landscape. But they can dominate that landscape so it's worth deliberately concentrating on the exceptions. Also this is just one limited person's opinions, during the panel my copanelists and audience will hopefully be able to fill the gaps.</p>
<h4>What do we mean by 'non violent games'?</h4>
<p>I think there's a few things that tend to get conflated:</p>
<ol>
<li>Games which do not contain any violence at all eg word puzzles</li>
<li>Game <em>mechanics</em> which do not <em>rely</em> on violence eg point and click</li>
<li>Games which do not condone violence on the part of the player character eg Undertale</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) is a contained in the intersection of (2) and (3): any game which contains zero violence can neither rely on it or condone it. But (2) and (3) aren't subsets of each other. There are games like The Wolf Among Us where the primary mechanic (eg talking to people and making choices) is not <em>inherently</em> violent but the player character still has to take violent actions. And there are games like Undertale which use an inherently violent mechanic (eg RPG combat) in order make the player think about what they're doing and subvert the usual violent tropes of the genre.</p>
<p>Also, I'm using &quot;violence&quot; in the narrow sense of malicious violence intended to cause permanent harm, but a lot of this also applies to games with no violence of any kind.</p>
<h4>Why is violence so popular in games?</h4>
<p>I think it's a combination of it being a very easy way to make a game exciting, and the specific history of the genre happening to encourage it as a default. I'm not really interested in exploring the historical reasons for it's popularity except to point out that there is space for game makers to think outside the box a bit more. But let's look at the practical appeal of violent games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being in a &quot;fight to survive&quot; is very exciting and motivating. And most fights involve fighting!</li>
<li>Destroying things and being violent in a fictional setting is cathartic but harmless</li>
<li>It creates drama and plot connected directly to the gameplay: X is doing bad things! Defeat X in combat and stop them!</li>
</ul>
<p>Some things which can fulfill similar roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fight to survive: the &quot;fighting&quot; is about gathering resources, escaping etc. Or it's a competition but not to the death.</li>
<li>Catharsis: Destroying inanimate objects. Winning. Dance/music.</li>
<li>Drama and plot: All the things humans care about that aren't necessarily resolved through violence! Love, school, competition, survival...</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let's look at some examples.</p>
<h4>Non violent uses of typically violent mechanics</h4>
<p>First lets look at some games which take typical violent mechanics and make them non violent, or at least allow for non violent uses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Games where you can kill enemies <em>or</em> sneak up on them and knock them out, or otherwise non violently defeat them. In the RPG Undertale you have to figure out how to befriend them, and the happiest ending is only possible if you avoid killing every enemy you meet, though there is also a special, much darker ending if you kill everyone you meet. There's <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun">quite a few games with this kind of &quot;best&quot; ending for minimally violent players</a>.</li>
<li>Fighting games where your opponent doesn't die when they lose eg Pokemon</li>
<li>Games which modify typical violent mechanics to change the meaning of a &quot;successful attack&quot;, but behave otherwise the same. I have seen mods of first person shooters that do this, for example. I'm not sure the resulting game would be very compelling.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Non violent mechanics</h4>
<p>Plotless puzzle games are often non violent, at least in essence: they may have the player &quot;blow up monsters&quot; but exactly the same mechanic could be used to pop bubbles or eat pieces of cake. Examples include Bejeweled, Solitaire, Tetris etc.</p>
<p>There's also games where the plot and mechanic are completely separate, eg &quot;Save the princess by winning the game of solitaire&quot;, but these are basically puzzle games with an unrelated plot tacked on. And in my experience the plot frequently does involve violence, along the lines of &quot;Discover the villain's plot, defeat individual evil schemes, have a final battle&quot;. But for example Regency Solitaire is a regency romance where the climax of the story is being proposed to.</p>
<p>And then there's games with a plot that is connected to the mechanic. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Point and click adventure games, hidden object games, and other genres where you gather items, explore, and solve puzzles. Some of these add the motivation of neutralising threats or have a big battle as the climax, but Hidden Object games in particular often avoid this.</li>
<li>Plots which require you to solve puzzles with some motivation other than defeating monsters eg Little Inferno (fight cold and boredom)</li>
<li>Visual novels and dating sims: these are all about moral choices and relationships eg Cinders</li>
<li>Life simulators: deal with every day problems like passing exams, earning money eg The Sims</li>
<li>Strategy: Design and manage cities/bases/countries etc eg Sim City</li>
<li>Exploration games eg Gone Home</li>
<li>Gathering reources: Harvest Moon, Glitch (a rare non violent MMO)</li>
<li>Design: Make things! eg Kerbal Space Program</li>
<li>Games with typical &quot;jump on platforms and avoid monsters&quot; mechanics where you only avoid the monsters, not kill them eg Journey</li>
<li>Solving a mystery: there often is violence but not performed by the player eg Her Story</li>
<li>Music games: the plot is pretty thin but it is about doing well at gigs and building up your career eg Guitar Hero</li>
<li>Survival games? Are there any where you aren't violent yourself?</li>
<li>Driving games. All the excitement and challenge of fighting with no actual fights! eg Gran Turismo</li>
<li>Sports: like a fight, but noone gets hurt! eg Madden NFL</li>
</ul>
<h4>Non Violent AAA games</h4>
<p>As we can see there are actually many well established and popular genres of non violent games, although the plots of these games sometimes include violence anyway it's not entirely universal. Where it is pretty universal is the blockbuster big budget &quot;Triple A&quot; games many people really mean when they talk about &quot;games&quot;.</p>
<p>Note that big budget is not the same as popular: consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games#All_platforms">List of best selling video games</a>, which includes puzzle games like Tetris, non violent sports games like Wii Sports, animal sims like Nitendogs, and life sims like The Sims. Non violent games have always been and will always be a hugely successful part of the games industry, they just don't tend to get much of the money. This is partly because of industry and community attitudes, and partly because the genres which are popular <em>and</em> expensive to make tend to be more violent.</p>
<p>Again: there's nothing wrong with some of these games being violent. Many of my favourite games are incredibly violent and I wouldn't change a thing. But violence being so ubiquitous limits the full spectrum of what games, and specifically big budget games, can be. So, let's look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_video_games_to_develop">the biggest budget games</a> and their genres and consider how violent they are and whether they have to be that way.</p>
<p>First person shooters like Call of Duty are the archetypical Triple A game and the violence is right there in the title. Some of these games, such as Deus Ex, have major stealth components, and sometimes even encourage the player not to kill anyone. I don't know of any where non violence is the default, however, or where you can be any less violent than &quot;hunt down enemies and knock them out&quot;.</p>
<p>Driving games like Gran Turismo aren't usually violent afaict, asides from crashes which you are intended to try and avoid.</p>
<p>Action/Adventure games like Grand Theft Auto, MMOs like World of Warcraft and RPGs like Final Fantasy are afaict pretty similar in a lot of ways: generally pretty violent but also with significant non violent aspects like exploration, resource gathering etc. There are a number of of non violent indie examples eg Glitch, and the hugely popular Pokemon games are violent in the sense of having battles but as far as I know noone actually dies. So there is definitely space in these genres for more non violent games. There are often already ways to play these games non violently, but that's usually not the most popular or expected approach.</p>
<p>There's a few big budget mystery games like LA Noire and Heavy Rain. They does contain combat but afaict it's not the crux of the game so a similar game without combat could plausibly be made.</p>
<p>There's no sports games on the list but I am pretty sure the bigger ones count as AAA, and are (I assume!) inclined to be non violent.</p>
<h4>Other thoughts</h4>
<p>Something I have found frustrating in other discussions of non violent games I've seen is the way that Hidden Object games get forgotten: they are hugely popular and generally not very violent if at all. But since they're popular with women they're invisible.</p>
<p>I know there have been interesting discussions on this topic but I can't find any of them /o\ Links and corrections very much appreciated!</p>
