<p>This is a walkthough for <a href="https://spiralatlas.itch.io/northanger-abbey-remastered">Northanger Abbey: Remastered</a>. This will also mostly work for the original Northanger Abbey game, although you will run out of content before the end of the side paths.</p>
<p>There is no single correct way to play this game, but this walkthrough offers guides to getting all the achievements.</p>
<h2>The effects of your choices</h2>
<p>The game records multiple things about your character:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gender and presentation, and whether a character is cis, trans, or unknown. This affects dialogue and appearance, but not story progression.</li>
<li>Whether a male or female presenting protagonist is willing to dance with people with the same gender presentation. This slightly affects dialogue, but not story progression.</li>
<li>Personality traits: confidence, goodness, and wisdom. These sometimes affect story progession.</li>
<li>Regular points (attained by doing things people like) and romance points (obtained by flirting) with relevant characters. These strongly affect story progression.</li>
<li>Various specific choices, the importance of which vary.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Character Creation</h2>
<p>At the start of the game various character traits are set. Primarily: Gender, presentation, and trans status, which do not affect the plot. But there is also the chance to affect the confidence score slightly.</p>
<p>You have the choice to set all these traits manually, follow the setup of the book (feminine presenting cis woman with relatively low confidence) or let them be chosen at random. It should be possible to get any ending regardless of your choices in this section, but to be on the safe side I'll use custom characters when confidence is relevant.</p>
<h2>Henry and Eleanor routes (romance and friendship) plus Alone ending</h2>
<p>Henry and Eleanor like you if you are good, wise, and keep your promises. You can romance one of them, or be friends with them both.</p>
<p>The most efficient path to all achievements involves flirting with Eleanor, but if you want to just flirt with Henry, or with no-one, save at the point labelled &quot;flirting starts here&quot; and avoid the relevant flirting choices, which are marked in bold.</p>
<p>[any gender/presentation/confidence choices]</p>
<p>&quot;Watch the people around you closely&quot; x3</p>
<p>[If you are presenting as a man, you choose whether or not to dance with Henry, either is fine]</p>
<p>&quot;You need not give yourself that trouble, sir&quot;<br>
&quot;Laugh at his joke&quot;<br>
&quot;Indeed I shall say exactly that&quot;<br>
&quot;Laugh&quot;<br></p>
<p>[If you are presenting as a woman, you choose whether or not to dance with Isabella, either is fine]</p>
<p>[any choice]<br>
[any choice]<br></p>
<p><strong>&quot;I hope so&quot;</strong>/&quot;I hope not&quot;<br>
&quot;Demand to know the reason for her sigh&quot;<br>
&quot;Thank you&quot;</br>
&quot;Dark&quot;<br>
&quot;Udolpho was written by Mrs Radcliffe&quot;<br>
&quot;Make conversation with Mrs Hughes&quot;<br>
&quot;But it has many other virtues&quot;<br>
&quot;Say no&quot;<br></p>
<p>[opinion of the Thorpes doesn't matter]</p>
<p>&quot;Isabella!&quot; (If Isabella outs you to John)</p>
<p>&quot;Point out her hypocrisy&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His sister&quot; (if you have flirted with Henry)</p>
<p>&quot;Yes&quot;</p>
<h3>Flirting starts here</h3>
<p>When dancing with Eleanor (Timing can vary):<br>
&quot;How fascinating&quot;<br>
&quot;How clever you are!&quot;<br>
<strong>&quot;How pretty Your hair looks&quot;</strong>/&quot;I am glad to have met you and your brother&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Talk to Mrs Hughes&quot;<br>
&quot;Perhaps he should give up on the venture&quot;<br></p>
<p>&quot;Very much so!&quot;<br>
&quot;I am otherwise engaged&quot;<br>
&quot;I really must say no&quot;<br>
&quot;Agree thoughtfully&quot;<br></p>
<p>&quot;Stay with Mr Tilney&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes&quot;<br>
&quot;But I have an engagement&quot;<br>
&quot;You have not!&quot;<br></p>
<p>&quot;I am sure Mr Tilney is never wrong about anything (sarcastically)&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For others, perhaps&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose he must think her very pretty&quot;<br>
&quot;How can you behave in such an immoral manner?&quot;<br></p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot;<br>
&quot;Open it later&quot;<br></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Very pleasant indeed&quot;</strong>/&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Step onto it&quot;<br>
[any choice]<br>
&quot;No wonder she wanted to avoid it&quot;<br>
<strong>&quot;I would be happy to be your confidant&quot;</strong>/&quot;I am glad&quot;<br>
&quot;Why would I wish that?&quot;<br>
&quot;It makes me worry for myself&quot; (implies your character is queer)/&quot;I think it is unfair on them&quot; (implies your character is not queer)<br></p>
<p><strong>[The choices here depend on your gender. Pick &quot;If I fell in love with a man&quot; to flirt with Henry, or &quot;If I fell in love with a woman&quot; to flirt with Eleanor]</strong><br>&quot;Your true friends would support you&quot;<br></p>
<p>MAKE A SAVE HERE</p>
<h3>Eleanor romance</h3>
<p>&quot;Smile at Eleanor&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go with Eleanor&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Does that mean you...um...&quot;</strong>/&quot;Thank you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How brave!&quot;<br>
<strong>&quot;Yes&quot;</strong>/&quot;No&quot; (only shows up if you've flirted with Eleanor)</p>
<p>&quot;Subtly hint&quot;<br>
&quot;Write&quot;<br>
[any outfit]<br>
&quot;Yes!&quot;<br></p>
<h3>Henry Romance</h3>
<p>Go back to the save made above.</p>
<p>&quot;Smile at Henry&quot;<br>
&quot;Go with Henry&quot;<br>
<strong>&quot;Yes&quot;</strong> (will only show up if you flirted with Henry)</p>
<p>&quot;Ask outright&quot;<br>
&quot;Write&quot;</p>
<p>[any outfit]<br>
&quot;Of course!&quot;</p>
<h3>Henry and Eleanor friendship</h3>
<p>Go back to the save made above.</p>
<p>&quot;Laugh awkwardly&quot;</p>
<p>Follow Henry or Eleanor's path, but don't flirt at any of the flirt points.</p>
<h3>Alone ending</h3>
<p>Follow any of the above, but don't write a letter to Eleanor.</p>
<h3>Henry romance: Book compliant version</h3>
<p>This doesn't get you an extra achievement, but is included for the curious. The game's choices don't all neatly line up with events from the novel, but this is about as close as you can get.</p>
<p>&quot;In the same manner as the original novel&quot;<br>
&quot;Ask Mrs Allen to introduce you to someone&quot;<br>
&quot;Complain to Mrs Allen&quot; x2<br>
&quot;You need not give yourself that trouble, sir&quot;<br>
&quot;Laugh at his joke&quot;<br>
&quot;Indeed I shall say no such thing&quot;<br>
&quot;Laugh&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Agree&quot;<br>
&quot;You do not seem so very old to me&quot;<br>
&quot;Gosh!&quot;<br>
&quot;I hope so&quot;<br>
&quot;Say nothing&quot;<br>
&quot;How can you say so?&quot;<br>
&quot;I hardly know&quot;<br>
&quot;Udolpho was written by Mrs Radcliffe&quot;<br>
&quot;Make conversation with Mrs Hughes&quot;<br>
&quot;But it has many other virtues&quot;<br>
&quot;Say yes&quot;<br>
&quot;I like him very much&quot;<br>
&quot;Very much, particularly Isabella&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wish her well&quot;<br>
&quot;His sister&quot;<br>
&quot;I would if I could&quot;<br>
&quot;Good riddance&quot;<br>
&quot;Find Isabella&quot;<br>
&quot;How fascinating&quot;<br>
&quot;How clever you are!&quot;<br>
&quot;How well your brother dances!&quot;<br>
&quot;Very much so&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am otherwise engaged&quot;<br>
&quot;...if we can see the WHOLE castle...&quot;<br>
&quot;Quietly accept it&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Apologise&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes&quot;<br>
&quot;But I have an engagement&quot;<br>
&quot;You have not!&quot;<br>
&quot;Agree breathlessly&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think it a very good one&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How kind of him to ask&quot;<br>
&quot;I have no interest in your brother&quot;<br>
&quot;Isabella let us go somewhere else&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Open it later&quot;<br>
&quot;You are humbled by your folly&quot;<br>
&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Step onto it&quot;<br>
[any choice]<br>
&quot;Something is hidden there!&quot;<br>
&quot;Some evil secret&quot;<br>
&quot;The general did something terrible to her&quot;<br>
&quot;Escape to the garden before she sees you&quot;<br>
&quot;(run away crying)&quot;<br>
&quot;How could you have been such a fool?&quot;<br></p>
<p>&quot;Why would I wish that?&quot;<br>
&quot;I think it is unfair on them&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go with Henry&quot; <br>
&quot;Yes&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Subtly hint&quot;<br>
&quot;Write&quot;<br>
&quot;A flowing dress&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course!&quot;</p>
<h2>Isabella and John Thorpe Endings</h2>
<p>John and Isabella respect you if you seek out and express enthusiasm for their company, but refuse to be walked all over, and demand to get your own way. There are various chances to flirt with them, marked in bold, which result in changes to dialogue.</p>
<p>[any gender/presentation choices]<br>
&quot;Lithe and delicate&quot;<br>
&quot;Etherial and golden&quot;<br>
&quot;Like a river of ebony&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leave Mrs Allen&quot;<br>
&quot;Complain to Mrs Allen&quot;<br>
&quot;Ask Mrs Allen to introduce you to someone&quot;</p>
<p>[Make any choices with Henry]</p>
<p>[If you are presenting as a woman, you choose whether or not to dance with Isabella, either is fine]</p>
<p>&quot;You do not seem so very old to me&quot;<br>
<strong>&quot;Well you are very pretty&quot;</strong>/&quot;Gosh!&quot;<br>
&quot;I hope not&quot;<br>
&quot;Demand to know the reason for her sigh&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;...including you?&quot;</strong>/&quot;How can you say so?&quot;<br>
&quot;Light&quot;<br>
&quot;Udolpho was written by Mrs Radcliffe&quot;<br>
&quot;Make your escape&quot;<br>
&quot;Say yes&quot;<br>
&quot;Isabella!&quot; (If Isabella outs you to John)</p>
<p>&quot;I like him very much&quot;<br>
&quot;Very much, particularly Isabella&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Find Isabella&quot;</p>
<p>You should not get invited to go walking or dancing with the Tilneys but if you do, say no.</p>
<p>&quot;He shall not escape you so easily&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would love to!&quot;<br>
&quot;Complain&quot;</p>
<p>Sit with whichever Thorpe you like more. If that's John, choose &quot;Change the subject&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand to see the castle&quot;</p>
<p>If you've flirted with Isabella:<br>
<strong>&quot;Then perhaps we should be more than friends&quot;</strong>/&quot;Very well&quot;</p>
<p>If you haven't flirted enough with Isabella, John will hit on you:<br>
<strong>&quot;If I had a partner as fine as you&quot;</strong>/&quot;I think it a very good one&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose he must think her very pretty&quot;<br>
<strong>&quot;How can you behave so in front of me?&quot;</strong>/&quot;How charming you two are&quot;</p>
<p>[any choice]</p>
<p>&quot;Do not let them go&quot;</p>
<p>Isabella romance:<br>
<strong>&quot;Not yet&quot;</strong><br>
<strong>&quot;Then I will make sure you never want to leave&quot;</strong></p>
<h2>Secret ending</h2>
<p>This character likes characters who are clever, inquisitive, and good, and doesn't like people who are mean to Eleanor.</p>
<p>[any gender/presentation/confidence choices]</p>
<p>&quot;Watch the people around you closely&quot;<br>
&quot;Talk to the servant&quot;<br>
&quot;Offer to help&quot;<br>
&quot;See if you can find that servant again&quot;</p>
<p>[If you are presenting as a man, you choose whether or not to dance with Henry, either is fine]</p>
<p>&quot;It is true, you are quite awful.&quot;<br>
&quot;Laugh at his joke&quot;<br>
&quot;Indeed I shall say exactly that&quot;<br>
&quot;Laugh&quot;</p>
<p>[If you are presenting as a woman, you choose whether or not to dance with Isabella, either is fine]</p>
<p>[any choice]<br>
[any choice]</p>
<p>&quot;I hope not&quot;<br>
&quot;Demand to know the reason for her sigh&quot;<br>
&quot;Thank you&quot;</br>
&quot;Red&quot;<br>
&quot;Udolpho was written by Mrs Radcliffe&quot;<br>
&quot;Make conversation with Mrs Hughes&quot;<br>
&quot;But it has many other virtues&quot;<br>
&quot;Say no&quot;</p>
<p>[any answer]
[any answer]</p>

<p>&quot;No thank you&quot;<br>
&quot;I really must say no&quot;<br></p>
<p>&quot;Investigate&quot;<br>
&quot;Do you know Mrs Hughes?&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;No, thank you&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, thank you&quot; (to the Thorpes)</p>
<p>&quot;I would love to&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose he must think her very pretty&quot;<br>
&quot;How can you behave in such an immoral manner?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would love to&quot;<br>
<strong>&quot;They are so attractively mysterious!&quot;</strong>/&quot;They are so intriguingly mysterious!&quot;<br>
[any choice]<br>
&quot;And if I don't turn back?&quot;</p>
<p>At this point you should have the Secret Ending achievment. You can also learn a little more backstory on the Eleanor path, whether romance or friendship.</p>
