<p><strong>Misc:</strong>
I spent a chunk of the day in the diversity lounge which was fun. I met some great people at the Gender Diverse card game, and got to the semi finals of the Xena Nintendo 64 Fighting Game Tournament (there were only three rounds, but given how much I suck at fighting games this was still a happy surprise, and a sign of what a random button masher the game is)</p>
<p>The gender neutral toilets near the diversity lounge were very well done, unlike GCAP the original signs weren't visible and &quot;with stalls/urinals&quot; was in small letters like an afterthought.</p>
<p>I didn't break anything on Day 3 but did break a mug the next morning. Also the cinema in the Crown Casino is surprisingly inaccessible.</p>
<p>Despite the various mishaps I had a great time and will definitely come again next time we can afford it.</p>
<p><strong>Queer Coded: A History of LGBTQIA+ Gaming</strong></p>
<p>I missed the second half of this to see David Gaider, feeling very annoyed at the programmer.</p>

<p>Most queer characters are just queer coded, with plausible deniability. &quot;It's up to you&quot;.Tendency for queer characters to be villains. Indie games tend to be more queer friendly than AAA games.</p>
<p>Lesbians:
First known queer character in games: 1986 Moonmist had side-character who was a lesbian murderer.</p>
<p>Other notable lesbian characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>KOTOR 2003, Juhani, first queer Star Wars character</li>
<li>Gone Home 2013</li>
<li>Dragon Age Inquisition Sera (I thought Sam Traynor from Mass Effect 3 came first?)</li>
<li>Tracer from Overwatch 2016</li>
</ul>
<p>Trans characters:</p>
<p>1988 Birdo from Super Mario Brothers 2 &quot;A male who believes he is female&quot;</p>
<p>Lots of others but all terrible. Jokes and villains. Trans women seen as threat. Poison from Final Fight 1989, &quot;so you can hit a woman&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Krem DAI 2014 trans man, You can't go &quot;Ok, cool&quot;.</li>
<li>Hainly Adams MEA 2017 trans woman. Tells you her deadname, this was patched.</li>
<li>Horizon: Zero Dawn 2017 trans man</li>
<li>Dream Daddy 2017 trans man. One throw away line about wearing a binder, had to be clarified by writers. Non binary people and cosplayers wear binders too!</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you make it clear they're trans without them implausibly outing themselves or just having it be word of god?</p>
<p>Gay men:</p>
<p>1993 fmv Dracula Unleashed has speaking role</p>
<p>Tended to be background characters, jokes and villains again. No m/m relationships shown onscreen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dreamfall: the Longest Journey 2006 (not made super clear until 2015)</li>
<li>Steve Cortez Mass Effect 3 2012</li>
<li>Dorian DAI 2014</li>
</ul>
<p>Dorian knew exactly what his sexuality was. Coming of age narratives get boring.</p>
<p>Bi Characters (no picture because they're invisible):</p>
<p>1993 Ultima 7 part 2 bi character propositions character regardless of gender.</p>
<p>&quot;Slutty bisexuals&quot;. A lot of characters are playersexual and it never comes up outside the relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li>Zevran DAO 2009</li>
<li>Borderlands 2009</li>
<li>Fable 2004 let player be bi, Fable 2 2008 added bi PCs</li>
</ul>
<p>Playersexual:</p>
<p>Only queer in the context that they will date players of both genders, but you don't see that unless you play as both.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dragon Age 2 2011, Anders only mentions his ex-boyfriend if you play as a male PC</li>
<li>Fallout 4 2015. Did have background queer characters.*   Stardew Valley 2016</li>
</ul>
<p>Non Binary:</p>
<p>1995 Chrono Trigger villain</p>
<p>Often robots, aliens or other non human</p>
<ul>
<li>Frisk Undertale 2015</li>
<li>Life is Strange 2015</li>
<li>Zer0 Borderlands 2 2012</li>
<li>Turing Read Only Memories</li>
</ul>
<p>Some games let you have gender neutral pronouns.</p>
<p><strong>David Gaider Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<p>1999 Working on Balder's Gate 2, didn't talk about his sexuality at work. Figured he would always be writing stories for straight people.</p>
<p>He was shocked to hear Jade Empire was having same sex romance. Got to be lead writer on DAO after that. &quot;So I can put same sex romances in, right?&quot;. More economical to have bi romances, but he would have been happier having some gay characters.</p>
<p>Feeling iffy about playersexuality after DA2, he asked for 2 straight, 2 bi, 2 gay for DAI. &quot;Minority content&quot; is weighed via the percentage of those who play it and those who appreciate it. Eg 5% play dwarves but most see it as a positive thing to be able to do.</p>
<p>Most of his time was spent on the actual plot but Dorian was the most personal writing.</p>
<p>He was targeted by Gamergate but it doesn't compare to, for example, how much Jennifer Helper was targeted.</p>
<p>10 years on Dragon Age was enough, his head would explode if he had to write another story about templars and mages.</p>
<p>How did you get the job: His story is very specific. He was managing a hotel and a comic book artist in his spare time. A friend was a character artist at Bioware but Gaider wasn't really aware of the specifics. Bioware told their employees &quot;If you know anyone who does game related writing let us know&quot;, the friend gave them Gaider's LARP rule book without asking. Got a call, gave the stories he wrote in highschool, got offered a job. He said no, it didn't pay enough, but then he got fired from the hotel. It felt like a sign.  </p>
<p>Who do you think will take the romance torch from Bioware: he’s not sure they're giving it up? EA treats romance fans as a reliable audience who don't need to be advertised to, even though it's why a lot of people play in his experience (though obviously those are the kinds of fans he will tend to meet). There is an underserved audience.</p>
<p>Most proud of: Lots of stuff he's not proud of. Wishes he'd been more involved in community discussions early on. Proud that the team tackled issues as they started arising. Proud of the company for standing by them. Most proud of Dragon Age 2 despite the mixed response. They had very little time to create it. It’s like a very big first draft. They had a plan but didn't get to compare notes once things were written, so he had to trust the team would stick to plan as much as they could despite things being cut on the fly. Team said they were happy in a post-game survey, didn't feel he was too dictatorial.</p>
<p>What does your writing look like, a screenplay? A cutscene does. But it’s generally structured like a tree that expands and then contracts back to the core path before expanding again. Flow charts.</p>
<p>Favourite relationship in a game? Morden in Mass Effect. Cried more than in a movie. Tali was his space girlfriend. Of the ones he's worked on, Morrigan will always be closest. She represents Dragon Age to him. Joyous time working with Claudia Black, first celebrity he'd worked with. Flemeth was originally Arabic, but that actress couldn't do it so they got Kate Mulgrew. They stopped looking for an Arabic actress for Morrigan and looked for someone who matched Kate Mulgrew. Claudia Black's audition tape was her reading Smack That like a beat poet. Gaider was very nervous, he'd never spoken to any actor before. First rule he was told was don't compare them to another celebrity, so naturally he said &quot;I had Helena Bonham Carter in mind when I wrote Morrigan&quot;. Claudia Black said &quot;So you're saying I'm a cheap Helena Bonham Carter ;D&quot;. She would say &quot;Does he want me to do it more like Helena?&quot; during recording.</p>
<p>Has being so closely associated with diversity had downsides? He may be gay but he's still white and a dude. He feels like it's all he talks about conventions sometimes. Teams need to sit down and look at what they've made. Lot of things made individually without concern for the bigger picture eg only 15% speaking roles in DAI were female until they stopped and looked at it and fixed it.  </p>
<p>&quot;We didn't think about it&quot; is no longer a defense. He wants to help with that, but we should be helping other marginalised voices get into the industry and amplifying their voices.</p>
<p>Wishes it could just be expected and we didn't have to discuss it.</p>
<p>He likes dating sim mechanics in the context of a larger story. But he does like the idea of romance not being as tertiary as it's been in Bioware games, romance as part of the adventure eg a romantic adventure. He's not really interested in social sims or day to day relationships. &quot;My idea of a spicy relationship is to have my life threatened.&quot;</p>
<p>Why do you think most AAA companies try to avoid discussions of lgbt stuff, why is it taking so long? Because it's Pandora's Box. There is more being added casually. But if they do nothing they get lumped in with the rest of the industry. As soon as they do anything there are 2 sides: 1. why are you doing this, you're politicising your game. 2. Why aren't you doing more, whatever you did is wrong and not good enough.</p>
<p>Not that flawed attempts should be above criticism. But by mostly focusing criticism on the games that did anything rather than nothing, people have increased the feeling that it's Pandoras box. He understands that it feels like those developers might listen to criticism but the dynamic is sending the wrong lesson.</p>
<p>My question: How do you think inclusion of non binary player characters can work with including gay and lesbian love interests instead of just having playsexuality? “We've thought about it”. He defined playersexual for audience, like Shroedinger's sexuality. He doesn't like it when the only way to have something show up is to have the character talk about it. eg asexual: character would have to sit you down and explain what asexuality is. Is unsexy as a feature. Explaining nuances of sexuality is off putting. If there was more nuance across the industry that would mean no one game has to do everything. Any one game can have only so much within it.</p>
<p>(This doesn't actually answer my question. I discussed it with my husband afterwards and even he didn't understand what I was asking, so I may have garbled it in my nervousness)</p>
<p>Are some choices &quot;canon&quot;? One of the features of Mass Effect and Dragon Age was the continuity of choices. No &quot;canon&quot; but there is a default. A lot of people feel like they have to play the whole series to get the full experience, was off putting, and he found the Keep a nightmare as a writer.</p>
<p>They had editors keeping track of which choices were incompatible. And that was just the third game. &quot;Can you imagine for a fourth game? Phew! Not my problem :D&quot;</p>
<p>Have you thought about the morals of gamifying romance, saying what people want to hear to get sex? Dragon Age didn't work that way, sex was not at the end. Some characters in DAI had no sex scenes, sex is optional for Dorian's romance. It's a game, everything is gamified, you can't simulate actual relationships. For proper reactivity you’d have to mark every response and keep track of inconsistency, but that’s too much work. Same with polyamory: too many variables!</p>
<p>Maybe get away from the approval system? Pay more attention to overall choices in major quests etc instead of individual lines.</p>
<p>Bi characters in DAI were bi from the start. Not the first thing that comes up during character creation eg Dorian started out as &quot;the good Tevinter&quot;. Helps avoid too many assumptions based on sexuality. But once characters started solidifying they would think about who worked for what sexualities. There's no set way to write someone &quot;as&quot; bi, but the writer can have them talk about relevant things in other scenes. Sera's writer is a straight dude, he didn't want to write About The Lesbian Experience, and got lesbians in the company to check out what he was writing.</p>
<p>Have relationships gotten more or less complicated? In Balder's gate 2 there was a single sequence of romance scenes which you could get kicked off. Dragon Age had approval. If it gets complicated but the player can't see it or understand how reactions relate to their previous actions it just seems random or predetermined. Unless they say &quot;I am angry at you because of X&quot;, but noone says that.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Fairbanks Talks about Addressing Accessibility Through Game Design</strong></p>
<p>lostandhound1 on twitter</p>
<p><span><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j7iC2w0a0gGWZ1IdtsrwSe6WXmlne9L3ofRPrhoAo3E/edit#slide=id.gc6fa3c898_0_0">His notes</a></span>.</p>
<p>He's not blind himself, and while he obviously cares a lot about accessibility had an unfortunate tendency to treat disabled people as a separate, if respected, &quot;Other&quot; to himself and the audience, even though I was right there in a bright red mobility scooter. He advocated person first language, &quot;a person with blindness&quot; etc, but not all disabled people like it and it shouldn't be presented as unambiguous best practice. I'm building up the energy to talk to him about it.</p>
<p>He's a sound designer.</p>
<p>Audio games: designed for people with a vision disability.</p>
<p>Audio game jam: the games tended to be about blindness as a bad thing. It felt victimising.</p>
<p>How can we make people feel powerful?</p>
<p>He was inspired by his dog's amazing sense of smell. The mechanic is that you follow an invisible trail using sound cues, a humming noise that gets louder and quieter.</p>
<p>Sighted people struggle with extracting information from sound. The game is more difficult for sighted people.</p>
<p>He had to add fruit on the ground as an accessibility measure for sighted people.</p>
<p>All music is diegetic: happening inside the world of the game, eg characters are singing.</p>
<p>There's a lack of much budget for audio games, since they're never going to make much money.</p>
<p>In 30 years current 30-something gamers will need accessible games.</p>
<p>Accessibility tends to be added as an afterthought or accident.</p>
<p>For example Pokemon has unique sounds for materials, collisions, monsters that accidentally make it accessible.</p>
<p>Sony reader: US only</p>
<p>Microsoft narrator: good but hard to use as a developer</p>
<p>EA: Proactively adding blind accessibility</p>
<p>Fighting games are often in stereo, blind players can play and even win tournaments.</p>
<p>Demand more from your games.</p>
<p>Developers: find a consultant. Address accessibility early.</p>
<p>It's about empathy. People with disability deserve the same stories to take part in as everyone else.</p>
<p>gameaccessibilityguidelines.com</p>
<p>daisyalesoundworks</p>
<p>binaural sound is going to make a big difference</p>
<p>audiogames.net: where blind gamers go to play games. They're supportive if you ask for advice and feedback.</p>
<p>People don't mind if you don't do immersive, game specific voices and just rely on the screenreader</p>
<p>Sound designers need more love to make VR accessible.  </p>
<p>Braille games?? He doesn't know much about it.</p>
<p>Curb cut effect examples: curb cuts for wheelchairs but also useful for prams etc. Subtitles. Think about short term problems that benefit from accessibility as well eg the screen is broken, there's sunlight on the screen etc.  </p>
<p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/LostandHound1/status/924876234206560256">Sounds of a blind person navigating their desktop</a></span>. To me it sounds like a mangled garble of little bursts of cut off computer speech, <span><a href="https://twitter.com/ianhamilton_/status/925779671240847360">here’s a description of what’s going on</a></span>.</p>
