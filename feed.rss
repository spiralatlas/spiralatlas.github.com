      </description>
      
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got asked to be on a panel about how I got into games for the Perth Games Festival, here’s the notes I plan to work from.<br><a id="more"></a><br><strong>Summary:</strong></p><p>I’m a hobbyist visual novel and puzzle game maker. I have health problems that mean I can’t work &nbsp;an actual job, I make games very slowly and don’t have the energy to promote them much so the income they bring in is always going to be limited. I treat it like a hobby and make my games “pay what you want”, so that as many people can play them as possible. Luckily my husband earns enough to support us both. </p><p>I’ve been making little games every now and then since I first got access to a computer as a child. But until a few years ago being in the games industry seemed both impossible and unappealing. I can program, but my talents and interests tend more to abstract ideas than the kind of fiddly technical problems that seemed to be 90% of games programming. And &nbsp;while I’ve always liked art and writing I never felt I was good enough to do them professionally. </p><p>The two things that propelled me into games making were (1) becoming so sick I had to quit working and needed a hobby (2) encountering the visual novel framework <span><a href="https://www.renpy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ren’py</a></span>, which takes care of most of the fiddly technical stuff I don’t care about but still lets me code in complex extra features if I want them.</p><p>I’ve since put out the original scifi visual novel SOON, the Unity based puzzle game Perpixeled, and the demo for a dating sim based on Jane Austen’s novel Northanger Abbey. <span><a href="https://spiralatlas.itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All of which can be seen on my itchio account</a></span>.</p><p>Over time I’ve connected more with other game developers, and while I can feel self conscious as a hobbyist they’ve been very welcoming, and it’s been fantastic &nbsp;for encountering new ideas and talking to people with similar interests.</p><p>Since game making is a hobby for me I use cheap or free tools, and avoid hiring other people. I have zero creative skill or motivation when it comes to music, until now I’ve relied on free resources but will probably end up hiring a composer to score a game one day.</p><p>If you have any questions please ask, and I will do my best to answer!<br>[[MORE]]</p><p><strong>Tools and resources I have used:</strong></p><p>Fairly easy to use:</p><ul><li><span><a href="https://www.renpy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ren’py</a></span>: visual novel engine</li><li><span><a href="https://twinery.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twine</a></span>: make text based games</li></ul><p>A bit of a learning curve:</p><ul><li><span><a href="https://unity3d.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unity</a></span>: general game making tool with an emphasis on 3D</li><li><span><a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blender</a></span>: 3D modelling</li></ul><p>Other resources:</p><ul><li><span><a href="https://t.co/iF8og7N81f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interactive Fiction discord</a></span></li><li><span><a href="http://letsmakegames.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let’s Make Games</a></span> a vibrant, friendly, and helpful community of Perth developers</li></ul><p><strong>More of my backstory:</strong></p><p>I did a Phd in computational mathematics, then worked as a science communicator and data analyst. I liked the idea of being more creative but lacked the motivation and self confidence to do more than the odd little sketch. And my attempted programming projects tended to stop working for no apparent reason. So I stuck to my strength: maths.</p><p>I developed serious chronic fatigue syndrome nine years ago. I had to quit my job, and could no longer do high level maths. I desperately needed a new source of purpose and accomplishment. So I got into making fanfic and fanart, where the bar for making other people happy turned out to be low enough for me to pass pretty easily.</p><p>About 6 years ago I encountered a fan game made in the visual novel engine Renpy. The game was clearly thrown together without much effort yet ran perfectly. Sure enough, the engine was easy to use and reliable.</p><p>I made a few silly parody games which was super fun. I liked the idea of making something original but wasn’t sure what.</p><p>Someone I know in the online femslash community reblogged a post on tumblr talking about how cool it would be to make a lesbian vampire dating sim but noone would be interested. A bunch of people, myself included, said YES I WOULD, and to everyone’s surprise we actually started making the game, now called Copper Rose. </p><p>It was a great experience, we all shared ideas and played to our respective strengths. At that point I’d only been identifying as a bi woman for a short time, and it was cool making queer fiction with a group of other queer women (which we all identified as at that time) After a while most of the team lost interest and wandered off to do other things, leaving me and one other person, Ash, who I have become close friends with. As it happened we both realised we’re non binary and bi, so it’s a bi non binary vampire dating sim now :)</p><p>And the two of us are still at it! Visible progress on the specific game Copper Rose has been very slow for various reasons, and the game doesn’t resemble the original much any more, but it’s still been a really amazing creative partnership. We’ve learned a lot about ourselves and about game making, and we have helped each other a lot with our respective side projects. </p><p>At the beginning of the Copper Rose project I was just the background artist because I lacked the self confidence to volunteer for anything else, but over time I ended up becoming one of the writers, and taking over the programming. </p><p>I now make original games by myself. I’m still not as good at any of writing, coding, or art as I would like, but I can do them all well enough, and have learned a lot and am learning still. </p>]]></content:encoded>

I met some great people at the Gender Diverse card game, and got to the semi finals of the Xena Nintendo 64 Fighting Game Tournament (there were only three rounds, but given how much I suck at fighting games this was still a happy surprise, and a sign of what a random button masher the game is) </li></ul><p>The gender neutral toilets near the diversity lounge were very well done, unlike GCAP the original signs weren’t visible and “with stalls/urinals” was in small letters like an afterthought. </p><p>I didn’t break anything on Day 3 but did break a mug the next morning. Also the cinema in the Crown Casino is surprisingly inaccessible. </p><p>Despite the various mishaps I had a great time and will definitely come again next time we can afford it.</p><p><strong>Queer Coded: A History of LGBTQIA+ Gaming</strong></p><p>I missed the second half of this to see David Gaider, feeling very annoyed at the programmer.</p><p>Anny Sims @ChattyAnny on twitter (I was too slow to get the others!)<br>Keely Thirkell<br>Hayley Williams<br>Soap Pejovic</p><p>Most queer characters are just queer coded, with plausible deniability. “It’s up to you”.Tendency for queer characters to be villains.

Figured he would always be writing stories for straight people.</p><p>He was shocked to hear Jade Empire was having same sex romance. Got to be lead writer on DAO after that. “So I can put same sex romances in, right?”. More economical to have bi romances, but he would have been happier having some gay characters.</p><p>Feeling iffy about playersexuality after DA2, he asked for 2 straight, 2 bi, 2 gay for DAI. “Minority content” is weighed via the percentage of those who play it and those who appreciate it. Eg 5% play dwarves but most see it as a positive thing to be able to do.</p><p>Most of his time was spent on the actual plot but Dorian was the most personal writing.</p><p>He was targeted by Gamergate but it doesn’t compare to, for example, how much Jennifer Helper was targeted.</p><p>10 years on Dragon Age was enough, his head would explode if he had to write another story about templars and mages. </p><p>How did you get the job: His story is very specific. He was managing a hotel and a comic book artist in his spare time. A friend was a character artist at Bioware but Gaider wasn’t really aware of the specifics. Bioware told their employees “If you know anyone who does game related writing let us know”, the friend gave them Gaider’s LARP rule book without asking. Got a call, gave the stories he wrote in highschool, got offered a job. He said no, it didn’t pay enough, but then he got fired from the hotel. It felt like a sign. &nbsp;</p><p>Who do you think will take the romance torch from Bioware: he’s not sure they’re giving it up? EA treats romance fans as a reliable audience who don’t need to be advertised to, even though it’s why a lot of people play in his experience (though obviously those are the kinds of fans he will tend to meet). There is an underserved audience. </p><p>Most proud of: Lots of stuff he’s not proud of. Wishes he’d been more involved in community discussions early on. Proud that the team tackled issues as they started arising. Proud of the company for standing by them. Most proud of Dragon Age 2 despite the mixed response. They had very little time to create it. It’s like a very big first draft. They had a plan but didn’t get to compare notes once things were written, so he had to trust the team would stick to plan as much as they could despite things being cut on the fly. Team said they were happy in a post-game survey, didn’t feel he was too dictatorial. </p><p>What does your writing look like, a screenplay? A cutscene does. But it’s generally structured like a tree that expands and then contracts back to the core path before expanding again. Flow charts. </p><p>Favourite relationship in a game? Morden in Mass Effect. Cried more than in a movie. Tali was his space girlfriend. Of the ones he’s worked on, Morrigan will always be closest. She represents Dragon Age to him. Joyous time working with Claudia Black, first celebrity he’d worked with. Flemeth was originally Arabic, but that actress couldn’t do it so they got Kate Mulgrew. They stopped looking for an Arabic actress for Morrigan and looked for someone who matched Kate Mulgrew. Claudia Black’s audition tape was her reading Smack That like a beat poet. Gaider was very nervous, he’d never spoken to any actor before. First rule he was told was don’t compare them to another celebrity, so naturally he said “I had Helena Bonham Carter in mind when I wrote Morrigan”. Claudia Black said “So you’re saying I’m a cheap Helena Bonham Carter ;D”. She would say “Does he want me to do it more like Helena?” during recording.</p><p>Has being so closely associated with diversity had downsides? He may be gay but he’s still white and a dude. He feels like it’s all he talks about conventions sometimes. Teams need to sit down and look at what they’ve made. Lot of things made individually without concern for the bigger picture eg only 15% speaking roles in DAI were female until they stopped and looked at it and fixed it. &nbsp; </p><p>“We didn’t think about it” is no longer a defense. He wants to help with that, but we should be helping other marginalised voices get into the industry and amplifying their voices. </p><p>Wishes it could just be expected and we didn’t have to discuss it.</p><p>He likes dating sim mechanics in the context of a larger story. But he does like the idea of romance not being as tertiary as it’s been in Bioware games, romance as part of the adventure eg a romantic adventure. He’s not really interested in social sims or day to day relationships. “My idea of a spicy relationship is to have my life threatened.” </p><p>Why do you think most AAA companies try to avoid discussions of lgbt stuff, why is it taking so long? Because it’s Pandora’s Box. There is more being added casually. But if they do nothing they get lumped in with the rest of the industry. As soon as they do anything there are 2 sides: 1. why are you doing this, you’re politicising your game. 2. Why aren’t you doing more, whatever you did is wrong and not good enough. </p><p>Not that flawed attempts should be above criticism. But by mostly focusing criticism on the games that did anything rather than nothing, people have increased the feeling that it’s Pandoras box. He understands that it feels like those developers might listen to criticism but the dynamic is sending the wrong lesson. </p><p>My question: How do you think inclusion of non binary player characters can work with including gay and lesbian love interests instead of just having playsexuality? “We’ve thought about it”. He defined playersexual for audience, like Shroedinger’s sexuality. He doesn’t like it when the only way to have something show up is to have the character talk about it. eg asexual: character would have to sit you down and explain what asexuality is. Is unsexy as a feature. Explaining nuances of sexuality is off putting. If there was more nuance across the industry that would mean no one game has to do everything. Any one game can have only so much within it. </p><p>(This doesn’t actually answer my question. I discussed it with my husband afterwards and even he didn’t understand what I was asking, so I may have garbled it in my nervousness)</p><p>Are some choices “canon”? One of the features of Mass Effect and Dragon Age was the continuity of choices. No “canon” but there is a default. A lot of people feel like they have to play the whole series to get the full experience, was off putting, and he found the Keep a nightmare as a writer. </p><p>They had editors keeping track of which choices were incompatible. And that was just the third game. “Can you imagine for a fourth game? Phew! Not my problem :D”</p><p>Have you thought about the morals of gamifying romance, saying what people want to hear to get sex? Dragon Age didn’t work that way, sex was not at the end. Some characters in DAI had no sex scenes, sex is optional for Dorian’s romance. It’s a game, everything is gamified, you can’t simulate actual relationships. For proper reactivity you’d have to mark every response and keep track of inconsistency, but that’s too much work. Same with polyamory: too many variables! </p><p>Maybe get away from the approval system? Pay more attention to overall choices in major quests etc instead of individual lines. </p><p>Bi characters in DAI were bi from the start. Not the first thing that comes up during character creation eg Dorian started out as “the good Tevinter”. Helps avoid too many assumptions based on sexuality. But once characters started solidifying they would think about who worked for what sexualities. There’s no set way to write someone “as” bi, but the writer can have them talk about relevant things in other scenes. Sera’s writer is a straight dude, he didn’t want to write About The Lesbian Experience, and got lesbians in the company to check out what he was writing. </p><p>Have relationships gotten more or less complicated? In Balder’s gate 2 there was a single sequence of romance scenes which you could get kicked off. Dragon Age had approval. If it gets complicated but the player can’t see it or understand how reactions relate to their previous actions it just seems random or predetermined. Unless they say “I am angry at you because of X”, but noone says that. </p><p><strong>Brian Fairbanks Talks about Addressing Accessibility Through Game Design</strong></p><p>lostandhound1 on twitter</p><p><span><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j7iC2w0a0gGWZ1IdtsrwSe6WXmlne9L3ofRPrhoAo3E/edit#slide=id.gc6fa3c898_0_0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">His notes</a></span>.</p><p>He’s not blind himself, and while he obviously cares a lot about accessibility had an unfortunate tendency to treat disabled people as a separate, if respected, “Other” to himself and the audience, even though I was right there in a bright red mobility scooter. He advocated person first language, “a person with blindness” etc, but not all disabled people like it and it shouldn’t be presented as unambiguous best practice. I’m building up the energy to talk to him about it.</p><p>He’s a sound designer. </p><p>Audio games: designed for people with a vision disability.</p><p>Audio game jam: the games tended to be about blindness as a bad thing. It felt victimising.</p><p>How can we make people feel powerful?</p><p>He was inspired by his dog’s amazing sense of smell. The mechanic is that you follow an invisible trail using sound cues, a humming noise that gets louder and quieter. </p><p>Sighted people struggle with extracting information from sound. The game is more difficult for sighted people.</p><p>He had to add fruit on the ground as an accessibility measure for sighted people.</p><p>All music is diegetic: happening inside the world of the game, eg characters are singing.</p><p>There’s a lack of much budget for audio games, since they’re never going to make much money. </p><p>In 30 years current 30-something gamers will need accessible games.</p><p>Accessibility tends to be added as an afterthought or accident. </p><p>For example Pokemon has unique sounds for materials, collisions, monsters that accidentally make it accessible. </p><p>Sony reader: US only</p><p>Microsoft narrator: good but hard to use as a developer</p><p>EA: Proactively adding blind accessibility</p><p>Fighting games are often in stereo, blind players can play and even win tournaments.</p><p>Demand more from your games.</p><p>Developers: find a consultant. Address accessibility early.</p><p>It’s about empathy. People with disability deserve the same stories to take part in as everyone else.</p><p>gameaccessibilityguidelines.com</p><p>daisyalesoundworks</p><p>binaural sound is going to make a big difference</p><p>audiogames.net: where blind gamers go to play games. They’re supportive if you ask for advice and feedback.</p><p>People don’t mind if you don’t do immersive, game specific voices and just rely on the screenreader</p><p>Sound designers need more love to make VR accessible. &nbsp;</p><p>Braille games?? He doesn’t know much about it.</p><p>Curb cut effect examples: curb cuts for wheelchairs but also useful for prams etc. Subtitles. Think about short term problems that benefit from accessibility as well eg the screen is broken, there’s sunlight on the screen etc. &nbsp;</p><p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/LostandHound1/status/924876234206560256" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sounds of a blind person navigating their desktop</a></span>.
